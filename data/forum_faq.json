    "content": "1\n\n🛣️ What’s the Roadmap? Where Is the Game Headed?\n\nWe’re a **small independent studio** - no publishers, no investors, no monetization plan forcing our hand. We’re not building Adrullan to get rich. We’re building it because it’s the game **we want to play**, with the people we want to play it with.\n\nAnd after 5 years? We’ve made it further than we ever imagined.\n\n**Here’s where we’re at:**\n\n✅ Core systems are in and solid  \n✅ Most major features are PoC or MVP  \n✅ The server tech has been in development even longer  \n✅ We have more hands on deck than ever before  \n✅ We’ve built a content pipeline that actually works  \n✅ We’re shipping faster than ever\n\n**🌍 World Building So Far:**\n\nWe started with **Handover Holm**, the test island (pictured)\nOnce we figured out what worked, we expanded to the full world.\n\nWe’re splitting the world into **three major regions**:\n- **West**: 4 starting races  \n- **Center**: 3 starting races  \n- **East**: 4 starting races  \n\n📍 The **East is nearly complete** from a city and zone structure standpoint  \n📍 **Pre-production on the central region is already underway**  \n📈 The **level cap will be raised**, and we expect to test the new region in a more “complete” state **within the next year**\n\n\n**🔮 What Comes After?**\n\nWe’re figuring it out. We may keep building as-is; we’re financially self-sufficient and not in a rush.  \nOr we may provide more access to players when it makes sense.\n\nOne thing’s for sure:\n📦 **Content is king.**  \nWe’re doing the hard work now to get ahead of the curve and build the world before we try to sell it.\n\nExpect:\n- More tests  \n- More reveals  \n- More polish  \n- More adventures!\n\nThanks for being here. There’s more to come. 🙏",

    "content": "📊 Performance / Required Specifications / Optimization\n\n🎛️ Performance / Required Specifications / Optimization\n\nPerformance / Required Specifications / Optimization\n\nGreat point! Ogre has it particularly hard given their surrounding biomes all have high chances for weather effects. Glad you were able to find a balance.\n\nI played an Ogre yesterday and noticed the movement was just really laggy. Took me some time to realize that turning off the weather effects entirely was like playing a whole new game. Soooo much better (my machine is horrible, so that was the issue.) Gameplay was great after some tweaks.\n\nAdrullan Online Adventures is in early development. Though we strive to keep things performant, optimization is an ongoing process. Our game also utilizes some of the newest features in lighting and visual effects. A modern gaming PC with a dedicated GPU such as an nVidia GeForce RTX 2070 or greater is recommended.\n\nYou can improve the games performance by adjusting the values in the Video tab of the Options Window (F8). \n- Weather Quality has a large impact - we recommend turning this to low or even off on lower end devices.\n- Shadow Distance - Both overall Shadow Distance and Npc Shadow Distance have a moderate effect.\n- Corpse Visibility and View Distance - Especially during tests limited tests, more corpses than is expected in normal play tend to accumulate. Turning off certain corpse types and/or reducing view distance can greatly improve performance if many are present.\n- VSync Options can help you fix texture-tearing issues.",

This creates a natural **“enemy of my enemy”** alliance — perfect for grouping across races (even those at war).\n\n💡 Pro tips:\n- Start in nearby regions if you want to be close from the jump  \n- Stick around your **home town** long enough to finish your local story and earn some cash\n- Once you hit **level 15**, the world opens up and **meeting becomes easy**  \n- Your second character? It'll be way faster and smoother\n\n💬 Looking for friends:\n- Use `/lfg` to mark yourself as looking for group  \n- Use `/who all lfg` to see others doing the same  \n  (These will eventually be in a full **social search UI**, but for now they're slash commands)  \n- Form a **guild** and group with guildmates  \n- Or head to https://discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1229970369260027964 \n\n⛰️ It might feel like a mountain now, but, **the vista from the top is one grand spectacular view**.",

    "content": "📊 Unique Selling Points\n\n# AOA Unique Selling Points\nAdrullan Online Adventures distinguishes itself in the crowded MMORPG market by embracing a deliberate retro-inspired design philosophy, but with a modern twist. Unlike other Retro styled MMOs, we focus on providing enhanced Quality of Life (QoL), a robust crafting system with extensive world exploration and non-combat options, and passive gameplay as a viable choice. We approach our design by boiling down what we loved, and what is missing, from these modern games. Then we take all our best design knowledge and best practices for modern audiences and recreate the systems through that lens. Our charming and vibrant accessible art style, combined with a cutting-edge voxel world, allows for rapid content creation and a fresh, engaging player experience. We're committed to avoiding the pitfalls that have led other games to become generic clones, while making concerted efforts to introduce new players to the rich tradition of strategic, social-focused MMORPGs like those of old. These key factors set us apart:\n\n## Large Apathetic World\nThe vast and indifferent world of Adrullan creates a sense of grandeur and mystique, eschewing typical heroic tropes for grounded, localized stories.\n\n## Social Engagement\nWe actively drive players to interact and collaborate, reinforcing a sense of community, reputation, and social friction.\n\n## Restrictive Travel and Exploration\nNavigational cues are contextually woven into the world, promoting an intimate, exploratory connection between players and the environment.\n\n## Strategic and Slow-paced Gameplay\nCombat requires thoughtful planning, and the overall game tempo encourages a relaxed, one-handed playstyle, accessible even to the work-from-home player.\n\n## Crafting and Collective Action\nCrafting is central to the game, with endgame targets often involving guild cooperation, creating a shared, immersive experience.\n\n## Preservation of Mystery\nThe absence of modern navigational directed maps, combined with subtle hints and concealed mechanics, fosters a sense of wonder and exploration, encouraging players to engage deeply with the world.",

Inspired by the charm of early MMO gameplay, our game aims to offer players an intimate experience that celebrates the roots of the genre while introducing modern refinements.\n\n## Game World and Setting\n### Large Apathetic World\n**Indifferent Environment:** The world is not centered around the player. There are no heroes; instead, stories are grounded and localized.\n\n**No Navigational Maps:** Players will navigate using contextual cues within the world, promoting a sense of exploration and intimacy with the environment. Maps provided will be stylized, simplified, and not show players absolute location.\n\n### Diversity of Races and Classes\n**Unique Starting Cities:** Various races and classes begin in different cities, enriching the game's culture and embracing content diversity.\n\n**Limited Travel:** A sense of grandeur is maintained through restricted travel, unlocking additional transportation methods over time.\n\n### The Hub Design of Adrullan\n**Guided Progression:** Guided paths provide basic skills and experiences, leading players towards Anatma's Point (working name) around level 15.\n\n**Soft Hub and Spoke System:** Anatma's Point (working name) serves as a central hub, orchestrating journeys across the world and promoting exploration.\n\n## Social Engagement\n### Grouping and Interaction\n**Encouraging Collaboration:** Grouping is encouraged from early stages, driving players to interact and form teams.\n\n**Social Friction:** Deliberate design choices create or omit systems to stimulate social interactions, backed by systemic support for positive interactions.\n\n## #Reputation Management\n**Importance of Reputation:** Players' reputations precede them, impacting their social standing within the community.\n\n## Combat and Gameplay\n### Strategic Combat\n**One-Handed Gameplay:** Designed for strategic thinking and work-from-home style gameplay, with optional focus-intensive content.\n\n**Collection, Skills, and Abilities:** Expansion of mechanics through collectibles, unique class abilities, and an emphasis on skills.\n\n### Crafting and End Game\nCrafting Importance: Crafting plays a vital role, with end-game targets often involving guild cooperation.\n\n**Mystical World:** The game world feels mystical, hiding details and requiring players to engage in detailed exploration.\n\n## Approach and Philosophy\n**Embrace Classic Charm:** Introducing new players to the slower, group-focused, and social gameplay reminiscent of classic MMORPGs.\n\n**Refinement:** Sanding off the roughest bits without eroding core tenets, offering an accessible yet authentic experience.\n\n**Addressing Alienation:** Recognizing ",
