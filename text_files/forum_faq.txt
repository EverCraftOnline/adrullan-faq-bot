When Will Progress Persist? Maybe - but not by default. We’ll always try to keep your characters between test phases, especially as we raise the level cap and expand content. BUT… 🔧 If there’s a major database schema change or something critical that affects data integrity, we will wipe characters. Clean slate when needed. There will be a wipe before "1.0"! TL;DR - ✅ We’ll preserve progress when we can - ⚠️ We’ll wipe if we have to - 🛠️ Future tests may include big structural changes, so expect the unexpected We’ll always give a heads-up before any planned wipe! https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1393984764389621931  🛣️ What’s the Roadmap? Where Is the Game Headed? 1 🛣️ What’s the Roadmap? Where Is the Game Headed? We’re a small independent studio - no publishers, no investors, no monetization plan forcing our hand. We’re not building Adrullan to get rich. We’re building it because it’s the game we want to play, with the people we want to play it with. And after 5 years? We’ve made it further than we ever imagined. Here’s where we’re at ✅ Core systems are in and solid ✅ Most major features are PoC or MVP ✅ The server tech has been in development even longer ✅ We have more hands on deck than ever before ✅ We’ve built a content pipeline that actually works ✅ We’re shipping faster than ever 🌍 World Building So Far We started with Handover Holm, the test island pictured Once we figured out what worked, we expanded to the full world. We’re splitting the world into three major regions - West 4 starting races - Center 3 starting races - East 4 starting races 📍 The East is nearly complete from a city and zone structure standpoint 📍 Pre-production on the central region is already underway 📈 The level cap will be raised, and we expect to test the new region in a more “complete” state within the next year 🔮 What Comes After? We’re figuring it out. We may keep building as-is; we’re financially self-sufficient and not in a rush. Or we may provide more access to players when it makes sense. One thing’s for sure 📦 Content is king. We’re doing the hard work now to get ahead of the curve and build the world before we try to sell it. Expect - More tests - More reveals - More polish - More adventures! Thanks for being here. There’s more to come. 🙏 https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1393983735489101906  🪦 Is There Hardcore or Solo Self-Found Support? 🪦 Is There Hardcore or Solo Self-Found Support? 🪦 Is There Hardcore or Solo Self-Found Support? Yes! As of patch 0.10.29, several modes are now available in closed testing! We're working out the bugs and refining them for a compelling launch experience. We love elective challenge-based playstyles and we’re building real systems to support them. That includes ☠️ Classic Corpse - Toggle on Full Equipment Drop like the old days! - Stock the bank for backups - No gear. No money. Naked corpse fun 🔥 Hardcore Mode - One life. You die, Hardcore street credit gone! Your Character can continue on however! If you can live with the shame. - Will have support for death tracking, announcements, legacy memorials, and more in the future 🧍‍♂️ Solo Self-Found SSF - No trades, no outside buffs, no handouts - Earn every item, coin, and kill yourself - A great way to play Adrullan as the world was meant to be feared 🫂 Group Self-Found GSF / Static Group - You and your friends form a party - The group leader hails a special NPC to lock you into GSF mode - From then on - You can trade and buff each other - But can’t receive help from anyone outside your static - You rise and fall together - Supports groups of any size, from duos to full parties 🏆 Achievements, Titles, and Bragging Rights are part of the plan too. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1392940741273059559  🏃 Why is my game running in slow motion? 🏃 Why is my game running in slow motion?

Ogre has it particularly hard given their surrounding biomes all have high chances for weather effects. Glad you were able to find a balance. I played an Ogre yesterday and noticed the movement was just really laggy. Took me some time to realize that turning off the weather effects entirely was like playing a whole new game. Soooo much better my machine is horrible, so that was the issue. Gameplay was great after some tweaks. Adrullan Online Adventures is in early development. Though we strive to keep things performant, optimization is an ongoing process. Our game also utilizes some of the newest features in lighting and visual effects. A modern gaming PC with a dedicated GPU such as an nVidia GeForce RTX 2070 or greater is recommended. You can improve the games performance by adjusting the values in the Video tab of the Options Window F8. - Weather Quality has a large impact - we recommend turning this to low or even off on lower end devices. - Shadow Distance - Both overall Shadow Distance and Npc Shadow Distance have a moderate effect. - Corpse Visibility and View Distance - Especially during tests limited tests, more corpses than is expected in normal play tend to accumulate. Turning off certain corpse types and/or reducing view distance can greatly improve performance if many are present. - VSync Options can help you fix texture-tearing issues. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1367133509876973699  🗺️ How Do Maps Work? Is There a Mini-Map? 🗺️ How Do Maps Work? Is There a Mini-Map? Adrullan doesn’t have GPS. There’s no mini-map. No auto-path to objective. No sparkly breadcrumbs. This world expects and rewards attention. Instead, we give you - A Map Window M with a simple, fantasy-style world map - Major cities and the Golden Road marked clearly - Possibly starting City maps see Leont Proof of Concept - Illustrated Landmarks Weenies to use as anchors - The ability to right-click and place pins wherever you want - select an icon - add a note - pin it all! - A layout that encourages discovery, not handholding 🧭 We want maps that inspire curiosity — not remove it. Think back to buying a new RPG and pouring over the folded map in the box. That’s the feeling we’re chasing. 📌 Coming Soon - Pin sharing with friends or groups - Quest and item pin drops - Localized maps for subregions - Optional city map expansions - More stylization and polish to match the world’s tone This system is still a proof of concept, but it sets the direction. We're building a map that grows with the world and its players. 🤔 Lost? Good. Use the world. Use the Golden Road. Use weenies landmarks. Use your map. Use your friends. 🧓 Magellan mapped the world without GPS. Adrullan asks for a little more attention, a little more thought — and we think that’s a feature. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1393964617683959920  🎨 Why Voxel Art? 🎨 Why Voxel Art? 📦 Content is king. This art style lets us develop and ship content fast, while keeping things cohesive, stylized, and pleasing to explore. 🛠️ Voxels give us - A powerful and flexible pipeline - Support for full server-side streaming - Tools that help us keep up with you, the players We don’t see this as “Minecrafty.” Our world is filled with hand-placed props, smooth animation, modern lighting, and curated design. It’s a vibe of its own. Fun fact The game originally started in full HD 3D realism. We made the shift to voxels so we could actually build this world and give it a timeless, evergreen style that new and veteran players alike can enjoy. 🏗️ Can I Build With Voxels? No, player voxel building is not part of the game. But the voxel system is used for things like - Spawn rules - Environmental requirements - Summoning So while you won’t be digging holes or stacking cubes, the voxel world is very much alive, and you'll interact with it in ways that matter. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1393015490254995498  🏦 Is There a Shared Bank or Account-Wide Features? 🏦 Is There a Shared Bank or Account-Wide Features? Shared Bank? It’s coming. We’re all about encouraging you to explore the full spectrum of race and class combos. Supporting your entire roster, not just one main, is a core part of our long-term vision. Planned and in-progress features include - 🧳 Shared Bank to pass items between characters - 🧬 Lineage Achievements for completing unique goals across multiple characters - 🏛️ Character Memorials for retired or fallen legends - 🪪 Increased Character Slots eventually We want your experience to feel connected across characters, without diluting the importance of individual journeys.

Adrullan isn’t a game with one big hub city and a cookie-cutter tutorial. It’s a huge, apathetic world full of diverse regions, cultures, and danger. There are many unique starting zones, each with their own flavor; no shared “starter island” here. So how do you play with friends? 🗺️ Open your Map M - it's a paper-style world map. - The Golden Road is clearly marked - Major cities are labeled - You can use it to plan your meetup 🏞️ Starting areas are clustered mechanically, thematically, and often share a common enemy. This creates a natural “enemy of my enemy” alliance — perfect for grouping across races even those at war. 💡 Pro tips - Start in nearby regions if you want to be close from the jump - Stick around your home town long enough to finish your local story and earn some cash - Once you hit level 15, the world opens up and meeting becomes easy - Your second character? It'll be way faster and smoother 💬 Looking for friends - Use /lfg to mark yourself as looking for group - Use /who all lfg to see others doing the same These will eventually be in a full social search UI, but for now they're slash commands - Form a guild and group with guildmates - Or head to https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1229970369260027964 ⛰️ It might feel like a mountain now, but, the vista from the top is one grand spectacular view. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1392882065086615612  🛑 “Help, I’m Being Censored!” 🛑 “Help, I’m Being Censored!” Nope. You’re being removed; and for good reason. Adrullan is a nostalgic MMO, built to recapture what made the old days magical - Families play together here - The art style is approachable for new generations to discover what we did - Your reputation matters anyways! This is a game where you’ll need other people So yeah - being a jerk isn’t just frowned on… it’s pointless. ⚖️ We have zero tolerance for - Hate speech - Provocation or baiting - Edgeposting “in character” - Arguing intent after being warned You may get a timeout.

Death Penalty 💀 What Happens When I Die? Death matters in Adrullan. Here's the full breakdown 🧠 After level 10, death = XP loss - You'll respawn at your bind point or other release point if available - You keep your equipped gear - BUT your bags inventory are left behind as a corpse 🏃‍♂️ Recovering your corpse - Grants 50% of lost XP back - Some classes can resurrect you for more XP restored - Res spells often summon you to the corpse too - Other players may have corpse summon abilities 🪦 Can’t make it back? - Visit a Dark Pact enclave currently Alpha Corpse Summoner - They'll return your gear — for a price 😈 Yearning for that oldschool experience?

Hell, we've all thought it at points. But here’s the truth 🎯 We didn’t start this to chase trends, impress publishers, or build a product. We started to make a game we wanted to play with our friends. 💵 At this stage we are 100% self-funded. No investors. No deadlines. No compromises. 🧱 Every piece of Adrullan was built by people who love this kind of game and want to see it exist - not just talk about it. 👥 This Discord? Started with just Hidden and a dream. Now there’s 10,000 of you in here. That was never the plan, but it’s been a wild ride. 🙃 So if you’ve come to tell us how we’ll fail… that’s fine. But know this 📜 The process is already the success.

We’ve got a few specific channels open for feedback during testing. You can also drop suggestions in the in-game Bug Report tool - Just pick "Suggestions" from the dropdown. That said… 🧠 We are not actively soliciting design input right now. We're early in public testing, but the design has been in motion for a long time; and we’re confident in it. 👨‍🍳 As the kids say let us cook. ❗️ Please don’t take silence as ignorance. We do read a lot of it. But also — you should never expect that we’re going to build something just because you asked. Some ideas may happen. Some may not. We're weighing dozens of perspectives, long-term systems, and the game’s soul — not just individual preferences. Keep sharing if you care and we can make Adrullan better together, but understand we're not crowdsourcing this. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1392115851850678375  💻 What Platforms Are Supported?

Unlike other Retro styled MMOs, we focus on providing enhanced Quality of Life QoL, a robust crafting system with extensive world exploration and non-combat options, and passive gameplay as a viable choice. We approach our design by boiling down what we loved, and what is missing, from these modern games. Then we take all our best design knowledge and best practices for modern audiences and recreate the systems through that lens. Our charming and vibrant accessible art style, combined with a cutting-edge voxel world, allows for rapid content creation and a fresh, engaging player experience. We're committed to avoiding the pitfalls that have led other games to become generic clones, while making concerted efforts to introduce new players to the rich tradition of strategic, social-focused MMORPGs like those of old. These key factors set us apart Large Apathetic World The vast and indifferent world of Adrullan creates a sense of grandeur and mystique, eschewing typical heroic tropes for grounded, localized stories. Social Engagement We actively drive players to interact and collaborate, reinforcing a sense of community, reputation, and social friction. Restrictive Travel and Exploration Navigational cues are contextually woven into the world, promoting an intimate, exploratory connection between players and the environment. Strategic and Slow-paced Gameplay Combat requires thoughtful planning, and the overall game tempo encourages a relaxed, one-handed playstyle, accessible even to the work-from-home player. Crafting and Collective Action Crafting is central to the game, with endgame targets often involving guild cooperation, creating a shared, immersive experience. Preservation of Mystery The absence of modern navigational directed maps, combined with subtle hints and concealed mechanics, fosters a sense of wonder and exploration, encouraging players to engage deeply with the world. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1391764262153748532  🧑‍🔬 Adrullan Online Adventures Design Introduction 🧑‍🔬 Adrullan Online Adventures Design Introduction 🧑‍🔬Adrullan Online Adventures Design Introduction 🪚Adrullan Online Adventures Design Introduction Introduction "Adrullan Online Adventures" aims to recreate the magic of classic MMORPGs, emphasizing a large, apathetic world, grounded storytelling, social engagement, strategic combat, and immersive exploration.

Here's the breakdown - /duel lets you challenge someone directly. - The Arena Zone has open PvP inside its borders. - Group vs Group and Team Arena 2v2, 3v3, 6v6 is the dream. We probably won't do a full open red server, but we are leaning toward - Objective-based PvP - Class synergy-focused battles - Scaling from group skirmishes to organized team content ⚖️ We're designing PvP around experimentation, not balance spreadsheets. Expect modes that play into cooperation instead of grief, but also expect some chaos and some OP comps. https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1391765421954302103  When i go to enter my password it fills the password box with all kinds of crap Unplug your controller! https//discord.com/channels/804170096082681876/1376257667990814842  I have no blocks on the menu scene or the character select screen Something is blocking the creation of folders.
