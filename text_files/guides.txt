Knowledge base content for guides Alpha Testing Status Current Alpha Status Closed Server - Friends and Family only invite only About Alpha Testing Adrullan Online Adventures AOA is currently in alpha testing phases. The game is in very early development with core system rewrites and many features still being implemented. Alpha tests are limited in scope and content - only a small fraction of classes and races are available, and there are intentional barriers and level caps that won't exist in the final release. Testing Phases We run periodic Open Alpha tests on the Tibolt Server. These are announced in advance and allow community members to participate in testing server stability and new features. Check our Discord for announcements about upcoming test periods. Important Note This is NOT a marketing presentation. You will find unfinished, unadapted, and intentionally truncated content. The intent is to analyze server and client stability with recent features and enhancements. alpha_announcements  Alpha Registration & Download Account Registration All account registration, verification, and client download is managed via the dashboard at https//account.adrullan.online/register Registration Process -
